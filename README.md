<h1>Spot the Colorful Turtle</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is an interactive Python program that demonstrates the power of the Turtle graphics library, blending randomization and color changes. The program features a turtle that moves around the screen in random directions until it ends circles itself while dynamically changing colors, creating a vibrant, visually captivating display.
<br></br>
<b>Key Features:</b>

- <b>Turtle Graphics:</b> Leverages Python’s Turtle library for easy-to-understand graphical representation, focusing on the movement and appearance of objects on the screen.
- <b>Randomization:</b> Turtle movements and colors are randomized using Python’s built-in random module, introducing variety and unpredictability.

<h2>Languages Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b>
- <b>Python IDLE Shell 3.10.2</b>
